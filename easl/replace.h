/**
*   \brief                      Replaces each occurance of a character in a string with another character.
*   \param  str       [in, out] The string that should have it's characters replaced.
*   \param  oldChar   [in]      The character that should be replaced.
*   \param  newChar   [in]      The character that \c oldChar should be replaced with.
*   \param  strSize   [in]      The size in T's of the buffer pointed to by \c str.
*   \param  strLength [in]      The length in T's of the input string, not including the null terminator.
*   \return                     The number of T's that must be allocated in the strings buffer in order to store the modified string.
*
*   \remarks
*       If \c strSize is equal to -1, the function will assume that the buffer is large enough to
*       store the modified string.
