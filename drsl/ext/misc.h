*   \brief  Main header file for the miscellaneous extension.
*
*   The misc extension is where miscellaneous string operations are put. These operations
*   either don't fit anywhere concisely or are too difficult to think of an extension name
*   for. Various functions in this extension may be moved to their own or another extension
*   later on.
