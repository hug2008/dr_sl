/**
*   \brief                 Retrieves the extension of a file.
*   \param  str       [in] The string that contains the file name whose extension is to be retrieved.
*   \param  dest      [in] Pointer to the buffer that will store the extension.
*   \param  srcLength [in] The length in T's of the source string, not including the null terminator.
*   \return                The number of T's that were copied into dest.
*
*   \remarks
*       If an extension is not found, an empty string is sent to \c dest. The destination
*       string is always null terminated.
*       \par
*       If \c dest is NULL, the function will return the number of T's that are required to
*       store the null terminated extension string inside \c dest.
*       \par
*       The extension of the string is considered to be the part of the string after the
*       last period ('.'). It is valid to specify a full file path if it's more convienient.
*       However, in doing so, the function will consider _anything_ after the last period
*       in the string to be the extension. In addition, there will be added overhead to the
*       function because it must scan a larger string if the full file path is specified.
