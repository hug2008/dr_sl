*   \brief                 Writes a character to the specified string
*   \param  dest      [in] The string that the character should be written to.
*   \param  character [in] The character that should be written.
*   \return                The number of T's that were just written to the string.
*
*   \remarks
*       This function will move the input pointer to the position just past the character
*       that was just inserted. The input pointer can be moved back to its original
*       position by looking at the return value. The return value is indicitive of how
*       many character units to move the pointer backwards to get it back to its original
*       position. A "character unit" is a char for a char* string, a char16_t for a char16_t*
*       string, etc.
