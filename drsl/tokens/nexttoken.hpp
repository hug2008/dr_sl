/**
*   \brief                      Retrieves the next token and moves the pointer to the end of that token.
*   \param  str       [in, out] The string to retrieve the next token from.
*   \param  token     [out]     The reference string that will recieve the next token.
*   \param  line      [out]     The integer that will recieve the zero based line that the token is on.
*   \param  options   [in]      The various options to use when retrieving the next token.
*   \param  strLength [in]      The length in T's of the input string, not including the null terminator.
*   \return                     True if a token is retrieved; false otherwise.
*
*   \remarks
*       This function does not behave like strtok().
*       \par
*       The source string must be null terminated. When the null terminator is reached, the
*       function will return false and the pointer will not be modified.
*       \par
*       When the token is retrieved, the input pointer is moved to the position just the
*       end of the returned token and _not_ to the start of the next token. Therefore, when
*       when the function returns, \c str == \c token.end.
*       \par
*       The line parameter is used to determine the line in the string that the token is
*       found on. This is useful for things like source code parses so that they know the
*       line that the token is on. This can then be used to output useful debug information
*       or whatnot.
*       \par
*       A token is _always_ seperated by non-printable characters, spaces and tabs. If this
*       is insufficient, use a different tokeniser. In addition, these non-printable
*       characters, spaces and tabs will never be part of any tokens except those enclosed
*       by quotes.
*       \par
*       Any non-letter and non-number is considered a symbol. Each symbol is it's own token.
*       A group of symbols can be considered to be a single token by setting the \c symbolGroups
*       string in the \c options structure.
*       \par
*       A quote is considered a single token. The quote symbols are included in the token.
*       Quotes are useful for keeping the formatting of a particular part of the string. A quote
*       character itself can be part of a quote, but must be preceeded by the escape character.
*       The escape character is always included in the returned string.
*       \par
*       Sections of the string can be ignored by setting the \c ignoreBlockStart and
*       \c ignoreBlockEnd strings in the \c options structure. If a starting ignore block string
*       is found, but a matching ending ignore block string is not found before the null
*       terminator, the section from the start of the ignore block to the end of the string is
*       ignored.
*       \par
*       When the function returns false, the input string is not modified.
