dr_sl
=====
dr_sl is a string library I wrote circa 2009 which I actually forgot about (originally
called easl). There's no point in letting it waste away so I figured I'd take the time
to restore it for modern compilers and fix a few issues. It's nothing special and a bit
over-engineered which tends to happen quite a bit when you're a young programmer! :)

The original intent for this library was to have it work seemlessly with UTF-8, UTF-16 and
UTF-32 encoding, however since writing this library I've never actually had any real use
for it so I'm not quite sure how useful this library would be.

This library is not optimal and has never been properly tested in any significant real-
world project (at least that I'm aware of). Use it at your own risk.

Unlike my other libraries, this one is written in C++ and released under the MIT license.
The decision for this license was originally because Google Code didn't allow for public
domain. I may change it to public domain in the future if I feel the need.
